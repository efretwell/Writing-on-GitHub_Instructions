Hello, World!

This is a demo project for learning how to use Git.

## Adding an image

This one is from an image added to my image repo. The repo needs to be public in order for others to see the image. 

## Adding a table

Ranking Emily Henry books and showing table formatting. 

| Rank | default -- | L aligned :-- | R aligned --: | Center aligned :--: |
|:--:|--|:--|--:|:--:|
| 1 | Funny Story | Funny Story | Funny Story | Funny Story |
| 2 | Beach Read | Beach Read | Beach Read | Beach Read |
| 3 | People We Meet on Vacation | People We Meet on Vacation | People We Meet on Vacation | People We Meet on Vacation |
| 4 | Book Lovers | Book Lovers | Book Lovers | Book Lovers |
| 5 | Great Big Beautiful Life | Great Big Beautiful Life | Great Big Beautiful Life | Great Big Beautiful Life |
| 6 | Any future books | Any future books | Any future books | Any future books |
| 7 | Happy Place | Happy Place | Happy Place | Happy Place |

See how -- (the default) makes the cells left aligned, --: makes the cells right aligned, :-- makes the cells left aligned, and :--: makes the cell center aligned

## Adding a collapsed section

Use the "details" tag to collapse sections.

You can use the default, where the section is collapsed ("details" tag).

<details>
<summary>EmHen Books ranked</summary>

| Rank | Title | 
|--|--|
| 1 | Funny Story | 
| 2 | Beach Read | 
| 3 | People We Meet on Vacation | 
| 4 | Book Lovers | 
| 5 | Great Big Beautiful Life | 
| 6 | Any future books | 
| 7 | Happy Place | 

</details>

Or you can make it so that the section defaults as visible, but can be collapsed ("details open" tag).

<details open>
<summary>EmHen Books ranked</summary>

| Rank | Title |

| 1 | Funny Story | 
| 2 | Beach Read |

| 5 | Great Big Beautiful Life | 
| 6 | Any future books | 
| 7 | Happy Place |
